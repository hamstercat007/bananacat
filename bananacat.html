<p>Banana cat was just an ordinary cat, until she ate a banana.</p>
<p>The potassium and vitamins gave her courage and strength. Her muscles became bigger. She was able to hear other cats in distress who were miles away. She was able to fly to them on top of a banana skin.</p>

  <h4>Jackson - the wet, stranded cat</h4>
<p>It was raining. Jackson was not a happy cat. Someone had locked his cat flap and he couldn't go inside.</p>
  <p>He whimpered, hissed, and looked angrily inside his house. Banana cat comes running to the rescue and flies towards him on a banana skin</p>
  <h4>Training to fly</h4>
  <p> It took Banana Cat a bit of practice to learn how to fly on her banana skin.(Click on Banana Cat image to activate it and use arrow keys (left, right, top, bottom) to fly to the other side.</p>

  <h4>Cloaking device</h4>
  <p>Banana cat also learnt to disappear from danger using cloaking skills.</p>

  <h4>The Magic Touch</h4>
  <p>Banana Cat also discovered that she had the magic touch, i.e. that she could just hover her paw over something and it would change colour (hover mouse over ball)</p>
  
  <div id="ball"></div>
  
  <h4>Disappearing food</h4>
  <p>Banana Cat had to learn how to control her powers.  Everything she initially touched would disappear. This was a bit of a pain considering she had to eat. When she touched her food, it would disappear. She was hungry (Click on objects)</p>

  <h4>The hidden door to Purr City</h4>
  <p>Banana Cat now had to find others like her.  But where? There was a hidden door to the gates of Purr City. When she knocked on the door (hint - click on door), the city appeared behind it. </p>
